## Blockchain

**Warning**: I dedicated this repository to my Blockchain study with Golang, but if you want to contribute with some content, feel free.

## Stack

- [Golang](https://go.dev) - Build fast, reliable, and efficient software at scale

## Content

- [Balance](https://github.com/PedroGaletti/blockchain/tree/main/balance/main.go) - Get the balance from transaction
- [Keys](https://github.com/PedroGaletti/blockchain/tree/main/keys/main.go) - Generate key
- [Store](https://github.com/PedroGaletti/blockchain/tree/main/store/main.go) - Store the key
- [Wallet](https://github.com/PedroGaletti/blockchain/tree/main/wallet/main.go) - Get the key by the wallet security file

## How to use

I'm using golang 1.19, and since golang 1.18 we can work with **go.work**, so to use and see the things that I implemented, it's necessary to run the following command:

```
go run ${module that you want}
```

Like:

```
go run keys
```
